## Challenge Overview
The dataset of this project is large size. Therefore, using excel to perform the analysis is not the best solution. Instead, utilizing Python power to solve this project is an excellent approach to creating an automated solution that can be used to solve similar problems.

## Challenge Summary
An automated solution to solve similar problems is needed with an efficient approach to handling large dataset sizes.
